# Self-Supervised Medical

This project requires installing Python (preferably 3.12) with the `venv` module.
It also assumes you have CUDA installed, with version 11.8 or greater. If this is
not the case, you may need to modify the PyTorch installation in `setup.sh`.

Then, to get started, execute the following:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:mattrrubino/self-supervised-medical.git
cd self-supervised-medical
./setup.sh
```
