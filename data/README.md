# Datasets

This project uses the Medical Decathlon pancreas dataset and the APTOS 2019 Blindness Detection dataset.
These datasets need to be downloaded and extracted into this directory. This is handled automatically by
the setup script `setup.sh` in the `code` directory. Simply follow the instructions in the README of the
project root, and the dataset downloading will be handled automatically.
